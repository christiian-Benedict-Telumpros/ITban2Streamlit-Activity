VI. Real-Time Video Stream with CV
1. Webcam Video Capture
The app uses cv2.VideoCapture(0) to connect to your default webcam.
This continuously captures live video frames.

2. Display Live Video
Streamlitâ€™s st.image() is used to show the video frames in real-time inside the app.
The video is displayed using a frame_placeholder, which gets updated every frame.

3. Apply Real-Time Filters or Detection
You can choose a video filter from a sidebar dropdown:
None: No change.
Grayscale: Converts the frame to black and white.
Canny Edge: Detects edges in the frame (with adjustable thresholds).
Face Detection: Detects faces using a pre-trained Haar Cascade model.

4. Filter Threshold Sliders
For the Canny Edge filter, users can adjust two threshold values using sliders in the sidebar to fine-tune edge detection.

5. Take a Snapshot
A ðŸ“¸ Take Snapshot button allows users to capture a single frame.
Once clicked, the current frame is saved and displayed below the live video with a success message.

6. Face Detection
Uses a built-in OpenCV face detection model (haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml) to draw green rectangles around detected faces in the frame.
How It Works Internally:
Each frame is processed inside a while loop.
Based on the selected filter, the frame is modified before being shown.
If a snapshot is requested, the loop stops and displays the captured image.
The video stream is released (capture.release()) after processing.

Extra Touches:
The video is flipped horizontally (cv2.flip) for a mirror effect.
A small delay (time.sleep(0.03)) is added to reduce CPU usage
